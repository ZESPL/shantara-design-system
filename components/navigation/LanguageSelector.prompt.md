Locale switcher for the public website header and mobile nav. Catalog documentation for this control is English.

```jsx
<LanguageSelector locale="en" rest="programs" onSelect={(code) => navigate(code)} />
```

Do not use flags. The trigger shows a globe, the compact code (`EN`) and a small chevron. The list shows every planned language by its native name: the current one ticked, enabled ones as links, and languages not yet published listed disabled with “Coming soon”. The control always renders — it never hides itself while only English is enabled.

Locale policy — planned languages, enabled vs published, page-level availability — lives in `ui_kits/website/SKILL.md` §15, not in this catalog.

**Motion.** The list rises 8px over 160ms (`sh-enter-up`); the chevron turns 180°. Reduced motion keeps the fade only.

**Accessibility.** The button name is “Language: English” (or the current native name). The list is a `listbox`. Escape and outside click close it. Visible focus uses `--ring-focus`.

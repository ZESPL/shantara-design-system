A photograph running to the edge of the screen on one side and a bottom-aligned text column on the other (deck slides 4, 6 and 13).

```jsx
<SplitSection src="/assets/photos/balcony.jpg" alt="A balcony over the valley" mediaSide="start">
  <Statement eyebrow="Mind · 7–14 nights" sub="Doctor-led routines, therapies and rest for guests managing sustained stress, poor sleep or fatigue.">
    Stress Management
  </Statement>
  <TextLink href="/en/programs/stress-management">Read about the programme</TextLink>
</SplitSection>
```

**Use** for one idea with one photograph: a programme, the rooms, the dining room. Alternate `mediaSide` down a page. `split="40"` gives the text more room when it carries a `SpecTable` or `PlainList` (deck slide 13); `bleed={false}` keeps the photo inside the container when a page already has two bleeding photographs in a row.

**Content.** A `Statement`, then at most one list and one link. No buttons beyond one `TextLink` — the page's primary action lives in the hero and the closing section.

**Responsive.** Under 1000px the photograph always comes first, full width and edge to edge at `mobileRatio` (default 4:3), and the text follows with the normal gutter. From 1000px: two columns (50/50, or 40/60 with `split`), the photograph fills its column's full height (row floor `clamp(560px, 48vw, 820px)`, change with `minHeight`), and the text column lines up with the page container on its outer edge and sits at the bottom (`align`). `mediaSide` only reorders from 1000px.

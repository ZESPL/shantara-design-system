The **offer** hero: a photograph on one side, running to the screen edge and the full hero height; the title, meta row, one line, the action and optional facts on the other.

```jsx
<HeroSplit
  src="/assets/photos/water-wall.jpg" alt="The water wall court"
  breadcrumbs={<Breadcrumbs items={[{ label: "Programmes", href: "/en/programs" }, "Detox"]} />}
  title="Detox"
  meta={[{ icon: "leaf", label: "Metabolic" }, { icon: "moon", label: "7–21 nights" }]}
  sub="Your doctor may recommend a meal plan or supervised fasting based on your assessment."
  actions={<><Button size="lg">Book a Consultation</Button><TextLink href="#programme">What the programme includes</TextLink></>}
  facts={<PlainList columns={2} size="sm" items={["Doctor review each morning", "Meals planned for you"]} />}
/>
```

**Use** on programme detail pages (and condition detail, tariffs, book-a-consultation) — pages that make an offer and need the photograph and the action visible together. Not for the home page (`HeroFullBleed`) or index pages (`HeroStatement`).

**Content.** Title is the programme or page name; category and duration go in `meta` below it, never in a label above. One primary button. `facts`: 2–4 plain items, no rates (rates live on the tariff surface only).

**Ground.** Merino by default; `stone` for a quieter page; `himalaya`/`pine` when the photograph is light and the page needs weight (Gold primary button re-points automatically).

**Responsive.** ≥1000px: two columns (50/50; `split="40"` gives the photo 40%, `"60"` gives it 60%), at least 600px / 88svh tall, the text column aligned to the page container on its outer edge and vertically centred, breadcrumbs at its top. <1000px: breadcrumbs, title, meta, sub, actions (full width under 520px), facts — then the photograph full-bleed at `mobileRatio` (4:3). `mobileMediaFirst` puts the photo on top when the picture is the point.

## Choosing a hero (exactly three)

| Hero | Purpose | Use on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HeroFullBleed` | Immersive — the place carries the message | Home (`height="full"`), Experience, one flagship inner page (`tall`) |
| `HeroSplit` | Offer — a photograph beside the title, facts and the action | Programme and condition detail pages, Tariffs, Book a Consultation |
| `HeroStatement` | Editorial — words lead, no photograph needed | Conditions and Programmes indexes, About, Insights index, Contact, legal pages (`ArticleHeader` for single articles) |

One hero per page, always first. None of them takes a label above the title: place, category or duration go in `meta`, below it.

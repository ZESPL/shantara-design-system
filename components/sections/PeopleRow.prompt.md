A statement, then two to four doctors in the same 4:5 portrait framing (deck slide 7).

```jsx
<PeopleRow
  eyebrow="Our doctors"
  title="Your programme is planned by our doctors."
  people={[
    { name: "Dr. P.A. Kareem", role: "Founder, Chairman & Chief Naturopathy Consultant", detail: "Government of India-certified Naturopathy Practitioner" },
    { name: "Dr. Bahja Janu", role: "Medical Director", src: "/assets/photos/doctor-bahja-janu-portrait-cropped.jpeg" },

```

**Content.** Names, roles and details come only from `content/doctors/`. Leave `detail` out while a field is `[TO CONFIRM]` — never write a qualification, a years-in-practice figure or a biography that is not in the record. A doctor without a photograph shows initials; never a stock face.

**Responsive.** Portraits auto-fill at a fixed width (about 150px on a 360px phone, growing to 280px), so two doctors sit side by side on a phone and stay portrait-sized on a desktop instead of stretching; three or four wrap onto a second row only when the screen is too narrow. The row caps at four portraits wide. The statement sits above at every size.
